# **Phishing Emails Classification**
This project focuses on identifying and classifying phishing emails using machine learning techniques. The project involves both supervised and unsupervised learning models to accurately detect phishing attempts.
## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a model that can distinguish between phishing and safe emails. The dataset used contains email text, and we aim to classify these emails based on their content.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/phishingemails/data).
The full Kaggle project is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/beratkaanakan/phishing-emails-mlproject)
## Methods

1. **Supervised Learning (Logistic Regression)**:
   - Logistic Regression is used to classify emails into phishing or safe categories using labeled data.
   - Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

2. **Unsupervised Learning (KMeans Clustering)**:
   - KMeans is applied to group emails into clusters based on their similarity without using labels.
   - The clustering results help explore the structure of the dataset.
## Conclusion
By combining supervised and unsupervised approaches, this project aims to provide a robust solution for phishing email detection, enhancing the ability to identify phishing attempts effectively.
