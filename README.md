"# Phishing Emails Classification Project" 
"" 
"This project focuses on classifying phishing emails using machine learning techniques. The project includes both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning models. Logistic Regression is used as the supervised learning model, and KMeans is employed as the unsupervised learning algorithm. The objective is to classify phishing emails accurately and to explore clustering methods."

"## Project Overview" 
"The aim of this project is to classify phishing emails using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning models. For the supervised model, **Logistic Regression** is used to classify emails based on labeled data. For unsupervised learning, **KMeans** clustering is applied to group emails based on their inherent characteristics without prior labels." 
"" 
"### Key Features" 
"- Logistic Regression for supervised learning." 
"- KMeans for unsupervised clustering of emails." 
"- Preprocessing of text data using custom functions for data cleaning and feature extraction." 
"- Performance evaluation through classification metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix for supervised learning." 
"- Analysis of cluster distribution for unsupervised learning." 
"" 
"## Dataset" 
"The dataset used in this project contains both phishing and safe emails. The features include the content of the emails, and the target labels are binary (\`Phishing\` and \`Safe Email\`), where applicable." 
"" 
"- **Source**: [Link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/phishingemails)" 
"" 
"### Data Preprocessing" 
"- Missing values in the email text are handled by dropping rows with null entries." 
"- The email text data is cleaned by removing special characters and stop words using regular expressions and a stop words list." 
"- For supervised learning, the cleaned email text is vectorized using \`TfidfVectorizer\`."

"## Supervised Learning Model" 
"" 
"### Logistic Regression" 
"Logistic Regression is used for the binary classification task of determining whether an email is phishing or safe. Performance is evaluated using the following metrics:" 
"- **Accuracy**: Overall percentage of correct predictions." 
"- **Precision**: Measure of true positive predictions." 
"- **Recall**: Measure of how many true positives were identified." 
"- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall."

"## Unsupervised Learning Model" 
"" 
"### KMeans Clustering" 
"KMeans is used for unsupervised clustering to group similar emails into two clusters. The model does not require labeled data, and clustering performance is analyzed by examining the distribution of emails across clusters."

"\`\`\`python" 
"# Apply KMeans clustering" 
"kmeans_model = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=42)"

"## Results" 
"" 
"### Supervised Model (Logistic Regression)" 
"- **Accuracy**: ~97%" 
"- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows high precision and recall for both classes (safe and phishing emails)." 
"- **Classification Metrics**:" 
"  - Precision: 97%" 
"  - Recall: 97%" 
"  - F1-Score: 97%" 
"" 
"### Unsupervised Model (KMeans Clustering)" 
"- Emails are grouped into two clusters based on their similarities." 
"- Cluster distribution reveals how well the unsupervised model was able to separate phishing emails from safe emails."
